# A/B + Belts:

1. Forgot to remove first belt and cut 2nd belt to size (but havn't cut anything, so should be equal-ish)
2. Some racking on the left side for some reason - will troubleshoot later: https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/mechanical/v2_gantry_squaring.html

# TAP:
1. Need to replace at least 6 x M3x6mm  (all stripped);
2. Should probably reprint the whole head / Tap due to kit being shrunk all over it seems
3. No jumper placed on PCB (OptoTap 2.4.1, not needed?)
